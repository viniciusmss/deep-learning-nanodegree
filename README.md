# Deep Learning Nanodegree (PyTorch)
Projects associated with Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree.

This repository contains material related to Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree program and is a clone of the [original repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch) with the exercise notebooks completed by me.
Most importantly, the projects noted below were executed more independently than the remaining content of this repository.

- [Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns](https://github.com/viniciusmss/deep-learning-nanodegree/tree/master/project-bikesharing): Implement a neural network in NumPy to predict bike rentals.
- [Dog Breed Classifier](https://github.com/viniciusmss/deep-learning-nanodegree/tree/master/project-dog-classification): Build a convolutional neural network with PyTorch to classify any image (even an image of a face) as a specific dog breed.
- [TV Script Generation](https://github.com/viniciusmss/deep-learning-nanodegree/tree/master/project-face-generation): Train a recurrent neural network to generate scripts in the style of dialogue from Seinfeld.
- [Face Generation](https://github.com/viniciusmss/deep-learning-nanodegree/tree/master/project-tv-script-generation): Use a DCGAN on the CelebA dataset to generate images of new and realistic human faces.

Pre-requisites
--------------

- Python 3.6
